# SIS model for recurring infections

The scenario simulates a sexually-transmitted disease using the SIS model in a hypothetical closed
community with no vital dynamics over a 10-year period. To configure an SIS model, the incubation
period is set to 0 and immunity is disabled. The infectious duration is 25 days and the
basic reproductive number is 1.2. An outbreak occurs on day 1.

With a reproductive number (R0) of 1.2, at steady state you would expect the percentage of infected
individuals to be 1 - (1/1.2) ~ 17%. Try changing the infectivity or infectious period to increase
or decrease R0 to observe the endemic state behavior.
